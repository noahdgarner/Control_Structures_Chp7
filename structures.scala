//Exception Handling with try expressions
//instead of returning a value, a method can terminate by throwing an exception
//method's caller can either catch and handle the exception, or it can
//itself simply terminate, in which case the exception propagtes in this way
//until a method handles it or theres no more methods left
//THROWING EXCEPTIONS
//throw new IllegalArgumentException
//here is an example of a throw with a result type that matters
//notice 1 branch computes a value, and the else branch computes nothing, exception throws are nothing
/*val n = 9
val half =
  if (n % 2 == 0)
    n/2
  else
  //throw exceptions on when writing reusable libraries
    throw new RuntimeException("n must be even")*/

//catching exceptions
try {
  val file = new FileReader("input.txt")
  //use an close file
}
  //syntax for catch clauses was chosen for its consistency with pattern matching (powerful feature)
catch {
  //ex: exception
  case ex: FileNotFoundException => //handle missing file
  case ex: IOException => //handle other I/O error
}

//example of a finally clause, this wil lalways be xecuted. use to check if file closed
//finally clause should not change any values, just do clean up
/*val file = new FileReader("input")
try {
  //use an close file
}
finally{
  file.close()

def urlFor(path: String) =
